Golly gee, it's another Go to JS compiler.

## Open Questions

- [x] How will we deal with existing Go standard libraries?
  - Standard libraries are opt-in and won't work out of the box (these + DOM are the only libraries internal to Golly)
- [x] How will the different base Go types map to javascript types? (like maps)
  - This is where Golly may have to be more strict than Go (e.g. map[boolean]string)
- [x] How will we make DOM typesafe, but not include it in the build?
  - DOM will be by default be an server-side API (like jsdom), but include interfaces to JS AST Nodes that Golly will call into over transpiling the Go code into JS
- [x] How can we implement the DOM's massive API as quickly as possible
  - We'll try to generate this using Typescript's definitions
- [ ] How will we translate and rewrite Go code when encountering global DOM objects like window and document?
- [ ] How can we turn goroutines and channels into async/await or generators?
- [ ] What is a []byte? Can it just be a string? How does that map?
- [ ] How does the JS variable scope differ from the Go's scope and what do we need to account for?
- [ ] Should Go's interfaces show up in the emitted Javascript in any form?
- [ ] Is it possible to "upgrade" an existing Go package to use Golly when you don't control the package's source, e.g. "fmt"?
- [ ] How will React/Preact look and work inside Go?
- [ ] Should we rename this project to Jolly? :-D

## High-level TODO:

In no particular order.

### File-Level:

- [x] implement if statements
- [x] implement loops
- [x] implement nested structs
- [x] implement classes
- [x] implement arrays
- [x] implement maps
- [x] implement functions with multiple return values
- [x] implement anonymous functions
- [ ] implement slices
- [ ] implement built-in functions (append, copy, len, make)
- [ ] implement spreads (users...)
- [ ] implement switch statements
- [ ] handle User{"a"}
- [ ] breaks, continues, panics
- [ ] custom types (type Blah = string)
- [ ] global variables, constants, etc.

### Package-Level:

- [x] support multiple files
  - files are wrapped in closures and the package wraps the file closures in another closure calling main()
- [ ] see if we can mimic rollup to decrease filesize further

### Hard but probably necessary:

- [ ] support goroutines and channels(using async/await)
  - we need some async functionality for things like AJAX
    - otherwise callback hell in Go? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  - probably makes sense to prototype this as a babel transform first 
  - if too hard or too costly, maybe just mutexes? gopherjs does seem to have a working implementation of goroutines and channels
  - for cross-browser we can run it through this: https://github.com/facebook/regenerator
    - this process relies on a Promise polyfill, but if written
    to use generators, we no longer need promises.
- [ ] handle differences in variable scope between JS <-> Golang

### Before you can use it everyday:

- [ ] write basic DOM package using Typescript's libdefs
  - Source: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/lib/lib.dom.d.ts
  - Typescript has a script to generate these files, so maybe we can use that 
- [ ] write preact package (~1000LOC)
- [ ] write fetch package (https://github.com/developit/unfetch ~50LOC)
- [ ] basic development server (livereload is fine for now)

### Later:

- [ ] add spacing (space, tab, newline) tokens into the JS AST to improve our JS output format
- [ ] implement defer function () { ... }
- [ ] error out on maps without key strings
- [ ] recover statement
- [ ] goto + label statements
- [ ] support go's select statement
- [ ] track functions declarations in use to do topological sort and pruning

## Design

- Small single-file builds that run in all browsers
- Compiles to ES3, the most popular JS dialect
- The "bucklescript" for Go
- Fast builds

## Wait, why?

- Javascript has become increasingly difficult to package up and distribute
- Despite all the hard work that's gone into Javascript tooling, build systems and traspilers remain slow
- Even when there's widespread WebAssembly adoption, Javascript will be supported for years to come.
- Go has a minimal, locked language spec and clear future priorities around better tools. Golly aims to contribute to this growing ecosystem.
- Go's type system and tooling make Go programs easy to understand & maintain

## Tradeoffs

**Go will run Golly code, but Golly may not run existing Go code**

Just because your code is running in Go does not mean it will run on Golly without modification. For everything that browserify & webpack brought to the community,they also brought with it mysteriously large builds.

Golly aims to generate clean, minimal & performant ES3 code that works in every browser. It will not jump hoops to make your Go code work inside the browser. 

If you need browser compatibility with existing Go code, GopherJS is much better suited for that task.

**Golly doesn't include Go's wonderful standard library**

All 3rd party packages are opt-in. This is to make sure that our builds remain purposeful and small. Over time, Golly will add compatibility with certain standard library packages where it makes sense.

**Golly aims to be a browser solution, not a node.js solution**

While there's a good chance Golly programs will work in node.js, it's not the focus of this project. The stack we're going for here is Go on the backend and Go on the frontend compiled with Golly.
